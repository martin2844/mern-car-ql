# mern-car-ql

A simple graphQL focused API.

The backend is hosted on heroku, whilst the front is hosted on netlify.

They honeslty could be both hosted on heroku, just by adding the build file of react to be served by node, and modifying the heroku command in order to build the file when the git repo is updated.

For now, it'll remain like this, as its just a proof of concept.

Enter https://car-graphql.herokuapp.com/graphql to check available queries.
